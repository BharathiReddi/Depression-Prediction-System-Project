# 🧠 Depression Prediction System  

📌 Overview
The AI-Powered Depression Prediction System is a machine learning and deep learning-based model designed to assess and predict depression levels. The system leverages Support Vector Machines (SVM) and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to analyze various input features, such as behavioral patterns, text data, or physiological indicators, to provide an accurate depression assessment.

Mental health disorders, particularly depression, have become a significant public health concern. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to provide a technology-driven solution to assist healthcare professionals in identifying depression symptoms efficiently.

🚀 Features

✅ SVM-Based Classification – Utilizes traditional ML techniques for depression detection.

✅ Deep Learning with CNN-LSTM – Captures both spatial and sequential dependencies in data for more accurate predictions.

✅ Automated Feature Extraction – Reduces manual feature engineering using CNN-based architectures.

✅ Textual Analysis – Can process time-based patterns (e.g., speech, text sentiment) for better mental health assessment.

✅ Scalable & Extendable – Can be improved with additional datasets and features.

🔬 Methodology
This system integrates both machine learning and deep learning models to analyze various depression-related features. The core methodologies used are:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification (depressed vs. non-depressed).
Works well for structured, tabular data.
Provides a strong baseline model.
CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model

CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Extracts spatial features from input data, such as text embeddings or image-based patterns.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks): Captures sequential dependencies, useful for time-series data such as speech patterns, heart rate fluctuations, or daily activity logs.
Improves performance over traditional models by understanding both static and dynamic features of depression indicators.
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Text preprocessing (if using social media posts or survey responses).
Normalization and scaling of physiological/behavioral data.
Feature extraction using deep learning embeddings.
